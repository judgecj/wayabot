               Easywaya is a financial technology company that builds more convenient and secure money transfer and payment solutions. Our first product is a money transfer chatbot that enables users to send money from Nigeria to U.S and vice versa.

              Money transfer from Nigeria to U.S has been extremely expensive and full of hassle for the past decades. You first have to go to the parallel market to purchase USD at a really inflated rate, stand in banking queue for hours before initiating a transfer. At the bank, you spend so much money in fees to transfer this money to your recipient who will end up getting it in 3 to 5 business days.

               This entire process is long, expensive and not convenient. With our chatbot, all you have to do is add a recipient and your banking details. Your account will be charged and your recipient gets credited within 24 hours and at no cost or stress. We make this possible by using a peer to peer model where money being remitted from U.S to Nigeria is used to disburse to your recipient in U.S and your NGN, which is in Nigeria, is given to a recipient of a sender from U.S.

               This chatbot will be accessible on facebook, skype, telegram and an app on the android and iOS app market.

                We started this service offline on October 5, 2016 and have since processed over $500k to validate market. We will be launching our chatbot beta on June 15, 2017 and with this chatbot, you can easily send money to your friends and family in Nigeria or to your friends and family in U.S

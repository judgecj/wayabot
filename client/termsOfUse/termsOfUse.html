                     Money laundering is the attempt to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of money. The federal government, using the Bank Secrecy Act and the Money Laundering Control Act, has written strict laws and regulations to help prevent money laundering activities. easywaya has a comprehensive compliance program within its organization to ensure compliance with government rules and regulations. We do not want easywaya services to be used in illegal money laundering activities. It is our policy that we follow both the letter and the spirit of the law and the regulations.
